🔥 Kaggle's 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course ( I have done it!! Yay - Got some Google Goodies!)

🪙 Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

🪙 Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

🪙 Day 3: Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

🪙 Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into creating and applying specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

🪙 Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications. (No Code Lab).

Advice: Use your own novelty as well, and also, the videos of Gen -5-day-Intensive are available on YouTube.
